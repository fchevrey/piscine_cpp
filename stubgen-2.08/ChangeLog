2004-05-12

	* Added -N and -l flags courtesy Raphael Assenat
	<raph@raphnet.net>

	* No longer bundling getopt() and basename() implementations since
	these are standard in modern libc.

	* Switched to BSD License

1998-09-14

	* main.c: Version 2.05

1998-07-27

	* lexer.l: added some c++ keywords
	need to handle typename, using, and namespace

1998-07-06

	and added .hpp/.hxx support for header files

	* main.c: changed revision to thousands-based integer

	* main.c, parser.y, stubgen.1, table.c, table.h:
	allow for empty class declarations, such as
	class Element {};
	also, differentiate structs from classes with
	new STRUCT_KIND tag.
	New version: 2.04

1998-05-27

	* pathname.c: made strip_trailing_slashes static

	* main.c: removed revision log from comment header

	* README, main.c, stubgen.1: radwin.org

	* stubgen.1: added lots of examples

1998-04-07

	* README: added supported platforms section

	* README: bumped version number, added build number, included
	ChangeLog in file listing.

	* parser.y: changed error-handling code significantly.
	several functions now return a value, and instead of
	calling fatal(), we do a YYABORT or YYERROR to get out
	of the parsing state.
	New version: 2.02.

	* main.c: removed YYDEBUG, and useless reference to yytext.
	setting tokens_seen state to 0.
	New version: 2.02.

	* table.c: made warning go away regarding malloc() cast.

	* util.c, util.h:
	made some warnings go away, removed extra yyerror() prototype.

	* lexer.l: changed error-handling code significantly.  functions
	like count() are now contributing to linebuf so we get correct
	parse error messages during lineno == 1 and other situations.
	also, instead of calling fatal() for collect*() functions,
	we return -1 and let the parser recover more gracefully.

	* Makefile: removed YYDEBUG

	* table.c: misc. changes

1998-03-27

	* main.c, parser.y:
	working on slightly better error recovery; not done yet.

	* stubgen.1: misc. changes

	* main.c, parser.y, table.c, table.h:
	added multi-line function parameters
	also changed pointer and reference (* and &) types so there
	is no trailing space before the parameter name.

	* main.c: silly mistake

	* main.c, parser.y: moved copyright from parser.y to main.c

	* main.c: bumped revision to match parser.y

	* main.c, parser.y: fixed a silly comment bug

	* lexer.l, main.c, parser.y, pathname.c, table.c, util.c:
	changed char[] to char * to make non-gcc compilers
	a little happier.  We need to #define const /* nothing */
	for other compilers as well.

	* main.c: New file.

	* Makefile, lexer.l, parser.y: moved code from parser.y to main.c

	* Makefile, lexer.l, parser.y: renamed stubgen.[ly] to parser.y lexer.l

1997-11-10

	* parser.y: fixed command-line flags: invalid options now force usgage.

	* parser.y: changed version info

1997-11-07

	* Makefile: misc. changes

1997-11-04

1997-11-01

	* stubgen.1: removed the bug about error-handling!

	* parser.y: new Revision string and usage info

	* lexer.l, parser.y, table.c:
	greatly improved error-recovery.  errors no longer spill over
	into other files because the yyerror state is properly reset.

	* Makefile, stubgen.1: misc. changes

	* stubgen.1: id

1997-10-26

	* stubgen.1: misc. changes

	* stubgen.1: Give credit in manpage, and also remove the bufsize[] BUG

	* parser.y:
	fixed constant_value so it supports simple arithmetic.  it's
	not as robust as full expressions, but this will handle the
	char buffer[BUFSIZE + 1] problem.

	Also removed expansion rules that simply did { $$ = $1; } because
	that action is implicit anyway.

	* lexer.l, parser.y, util.c, util.h:
	changed inform_user and fatal functions to use varargs

	* lexer.l: support macros within comments, etc.

	* util.c, util.h: removeDefaultValues() not needed

	* Makefile: clean

	* Makefile: clean rule

	* parser.y: Fixed this bug:
	stubgen dies on the following because the protected section is empty:

	class WidgetCsg : public WidgetLens {
	 protected:

	 public:
	     virtual ~WidgetCsg() {}
	              WidgetCsg();
	};

	Error:
	stubgen version 2.0-beta $Revision: 1.8 $.
	parse error at line 4, file test.H:
	 public:
	      ^

1997-10-16

	added support for elipses, static member/array initializers,
	and bitfields.

	* stubgen.1: misc. changes

	* lexer.l: Fixed compiler warning on win32 from <ctype.h> and isspace()

	* parser.y: cleaned up usage info

	* getopt.c: misc. changes

	* stubgen.1: macros fixed!

	* lexer.l, parser.y, table.c, table.h:
	handle extern "C" blocks better now, and support multi-line
	macros.  still need error-checking.

1997-10-15

	* lexer.l, parser.y, table.c, table.h:
	changed tons of names.  stubelem -> sytaxelem,
	stubin -> infile, stubout -> outfile, stublog -> logfile.

	* lexer.l, table.c, table.h, util.c, util.h:
	rearranged table.[ch] and util.[ch] so that util pkg
	knows nothing about stubelems.

	* parser.y: fixed up function_hdr

	* stubgen.1: fixed extern "c" bug!

1997-09-26

	* parser.y: now allow "struct foobar *f" to appear in a parameter
	list or as a variable decl.  Had to remove the
	class_or_struct rule and blow up the class_specifier
	description.

	* parser.y:
	fixed memory leak involving template decls in skeleton code.
	Leads me to believe that skel_elemcmp() is flawed, because
	it may rely in parent->templ info.

	* stubgen.1: removed note about signatures not matching

	* parser.y, table.c, table.h, util.c:
	changed parameter handing from char *'s to an argument type
	to facilitate comparisons between skeleton code
	and header code.  Now we can correctly recognize different
	parameter names while still maintaining the same signature.

1997-09-25

	* README: misc. changes

	* parser.y: added better base type support -- recognize things like
	"long long" and "short int" now.

1997-09-19

	* Makefile: misc. changes

	* Makefile: removed tar rule

	* parser.y: allowed an instance name to come after a class, struct,
	union, or enum.  This improves parseability of typedefs
	commonly found in c header files, although true typedefs are
	not understood.

	* Makefile: misc. changes

	* README: New file.

1997-09-15

	* Makefile, parser.y, table.c, table.h:
	did more revision on the SGDEBUG stuff

	* parser.y: allow logging to be compiled out by turning off SGDEBUG

	* Makefile: tar rule updated

1997-09-11

	* parser.y: duh, silly me.  messed up compilation.

	* parser.y: Revision string inserted in usage

	* parser.y: string copyright added to code for binary copyright.

	* parser.y: some more compactness of grammar with parameter_list_opt
	and also ampersand_opt

	* Makefile, parser.y, stubgen.1:
	better template support, but still poor

1997-09-08

	* parser.y: changes to error-handling code.
	also got rid of the %type <flag> for the top-level rules

	* util.c: misc. changes

	* stubgen.1: New file.

	* parser.y: cleaned up options and usage info.

1997-09-05

	* parser.y: changed options for .ext instead of -l or -x

	* Makefile: misc. changes

	* getopt.c, getopt.h: New file.

	* lexer.l, parser.y, table.c, table.h, util.c:
	works for scanning old versions, except for parameter
	names that differ between .H and .C files.

	* lexer.l: rcsid

	* lexer.l, parser.y, pathname.c, pathname.h, table.c, table.h, util.c, util.h:
	GPL-ized code.

	* lexer.l: changed email address to acm.org

	* parser.y, pathname.c, pathname.h, table.c, table.h, util.c, util.h:
	some simple cleanup before GPL-izing the code

1997-09-04

	* Makefile, parser.y, table.c: whoo-hoo!  by blowing up the description
	exponentially, it works!

1997-03-20

	* Makefile, parser.y, table.c, table.h, util.c, util.h:
	renamed stubelem to stubelem_t, cleaned up throw_decl

1996-10-02

	* parser.y: using pathname.h instead of libgen.h

	* pathname.c, pathname.h, pathname_tst.c: New file.

1996-09-12

	* Makefile, lexer.l, parser.y, table.c, table.h, util.c, util.h:
	Added throw decl recognition (great, another 4 bytes in stubelem)
	and cleaned up the grammar so that const_opt appears in far fewer
	places.  const_opt is by default 0 as well, so we don't need to
	pass it as an arg to new_elem().

	I also added a fix to a potential bug with the MINIT and INLIN
	exclusive start states.  I think they could have been confused
	by braces within comments, so now I'm grabbing comments in those
	states as well.

1996-09-11

	* Makefile, parser.y, table.h, util.c, util.h:
	changed expand strategy.  Don't expand while parsing now;
	enqueue as we go along and expand at the end.  Eventually
	we'll need to provide similar behavior for when we parse
	.C files

	* table.c, table.h: Just added the RCS header, that's all

	* Makefile, lexer.l, parser.y, table.c, table.h:
	No concrete changes in code.  Just added some sanity by
	factoring out code into util.[ch] and putting some prototypes
	that were in table.h into stubgen.y where they belong.

	* util.c, util.h: New file.

1996-09-06

	* table.h: defined the some_KIND constants for clarity.

	* parser.y: defined the some_KIND constants for clarity, and made
	expandClass return immediately if it was give something other
	than a CLASS_KIND element.

	* Makefile: Added TAGS table rule.

	* parser.y: Almost there with expanded operator goodies.  Still need
	to get OPERATOR type_name to work.

1996-09-04

	* parser.y, table.c, table.h:
	nested classes work and default arguments are now removed
	from the parameter lists.

	* parser.y: non-functional expanded code.  needs work.

1996-09-01

	* parser.y: put the expanded_operator code back in as a useless rule.
	oughta think about fixing it up if possible

	* lexer.l, parser.y, table.h:
	Added collectMemberInitList() function, which is similar
	to collectInlineDef() and also the exclusive state MINIT

	* Makefile: removed log info from header

	* table.c, table.h: changed from 2-tabs to 4-tabs

1996-08-22

	* lexer.l, parser.y: fixed up some more portability things

1996-08-21

	* lexer.l, parser.y: added parse error message (using O'Reilly p. 274)

	* parser.y: added support for template instantiation in the type_name
	rule.  surprisingly it didn't cause any shift/reduce conflicts.

	* lexer.l: removed the buffer for inlines.  we don't care anyway.
	now we can't overflow on inlines!

	* lexer.l, parser.y: added some cpp directives for porting to WIN32

1996-08-20

	* Makefile: made stubgen.tar depend on the source files

	* Makefile, parser.y, table.h:
	approaching stability and usability.  command line arguments
	are handled now and the fopens and fcloses appear to work.

	* parser.y: added initial support for optind but it is incomplete.

1996-08-19

	* parser.y: misordered args, fixed bug

	* parser.y: RCS got confused with the RCS-style header goodies.
	got it cleaned up now.

	* Makefile: Removed main.c -- now all in stubgen.y.  Also
	fixed silly makefile header

	* parser.y: Removed the expanded code checking and added
	lots of code that duplicates what stubgen.pl did.
	still need options pretty badly

	* lexer.l: no echo now

	* table.c, table.h: now reversing the list of members so they come out
	in FIFO instead of LIFO

1996-08-17

	* table.h: added the RCS header

	* parser.y: added the expanded operator code, cleaned up tabs.
	consider putting all of the expanded code in another
	grammar - this one is getting cluttered.

1996-08-15

	* table.c: New file.

	* table.h:
	rearranged some goodies so the declarations are now in table.c
	instead of this one.

	* lexer.l: misc. changes

	* parser.y: added template control and fixed up the expanded
	function recognition.  also add multiple variables
	such as int a, b, c;

	* Makefile: fixed for table.c and table.h

1996-08-14

	* Makefile: removed the -L option from flex so we can track #lines

	* Makefile: added header with modfication history control.
	compiles just fine.  :-)

	* Makefile, lexer.l: misc. changes

	* Makefile, lexer.l, parser.y, table.h: New file.
